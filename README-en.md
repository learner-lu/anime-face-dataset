# Anime face dataset

## Introduction

This is a dataset of cartoon avatars. All pictures come from <http://konachan.net/post/> and <https://wallhaven.cc/>

Crawl a total of 32151 Ultra HD pictures (22.7gb) and use [GitHub animation face detection](https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface) to collect all animation avatars

In addition to automatic recognition, I also **manually** select for three times, and I can ensure that I have seen each image at least twice

- Eliminate some low quality pictures and low resolution pictures

- Eliminate some repeated pictures

- Eliminate pictures with strange saturation, contrast and brightness

- Eliminate some other strange pictures which I don't like

## Dataset Characteristics

- The total number of pictures is, and the size of all pictures is **256x256**
